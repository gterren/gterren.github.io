    abstract = {The interest in solar radiation prediction has increased greatly in recent times among the scientific community. In this context, Machine Learning techniques have shown their ability to learn accurate prediction models. The aim of this paper is to go one step further and automatically achieve interpretability during the learning process by performing dimensionality reduction on the input variables. To this end, three non standard multivariate feature selection approaches are applied, based on the adaptation of strong learning algorithms to the feature selection task, as well as a battery of classic dimensionality reduction models. The goal is to obtain robust sets of features that not only improve prediction accuracy but also provide more interpretable and consistent results. Real data from the Weather Research and Forecasting model, which produces a very large number of variables, is used as the input. As is to be expected, the results prove that dimensionality reduction in general is a useful tool for improving performance, as well as easing the interpretability of the results. In fact, the proposed non standard methods offer important accuracy improvements and one of them provides with an intuitive and reduced selection of features and mesoscale nodes (around 10% of the initial variables centered on three specific nodes).}

    abstract = {In a system used for short-term forecasting of solar irradiance, multiple longwave infrared sensors are used to acquire an image of a large, continuous section of the sky dome. The field of view of each sensor is directed at a particular, fixed portion of the sky dome, with some overlap between adjacent edges of each field of view to ensure that a continuous image can be acquired. Because of unavoidable imperfections in the optical components and in the alignment of the sensors, and because of the complex optics, it is difficult to pre-determine adjustable parameters in the geometric transformations required to merge the multiple images into a single one. Instead, it is possible to do this experimentally, by rotating the imaging sensor array via a two-axis rotating platform, using the sun itself as a convenient far-field reference object, and using the images collected to generate relations that map each sensor pixel into an altitude-azimuth direction, α and ϕ respectively. The experimental proof of concept of this method is described here.}

The DAQ system is nicknamed the Girasol Machine (Girasol means Sunflower in Spanish). The sky imaging system consists of a longwave infrared (IR) camera and a visible (VI) light camera with a fisheye lens attached to it. The cameras are installed inside a weatherproof enclosure that it is mounted on a solar tracker. The tracker updates its pan and tilt every second using a solar position algorithm to maintain the Sun in the center of the IR and VI images. A pyranometer is situated on a horizontal mount next to the DAQ system to measure GSI. The dataset, composed of IR images, VI images, GSI measurements, and the Sun’s positions, has been tagged with timestamps.}

Forecasting global solar irradiance could address this problem by providing the power grid with the capability of scheduling the storage and dispatch of energy. The occlusion of the Sun by clouds is the main cause of instabilities in the generation of solar energy. This investigation proposes a method to visualize the wind velocity field in sequences of longwave infrared images of clouds when there are multiple wind velocity fields in an image. This method can be used to forecast the occlusion of the Sun by clouds, providing stability in the generation of solar energy. Unsupervised learning is implemented to infer the distribution of the clouds’ velocity vectors and heights in multiple wind velocity fields in an infrared image. A multi-output weighted support vector machine with flow constraints is used to extrapolate the wind velocity fields to the entire frame, visualizing the path of the clouds. The proposed method is capable of approximating the wind velocity field in a small air parcel using the velocity vectors and physical features of clouds extracted from infrared images. Assuming that the streamlines are pathlines, the visualization of the wind velocity field can be used for forecasting cloud occlusions of the Sun. This is of importance when considering ways of increasing the stability of solar energy generation.}

    abstract={The intermittency of solar energy produces instabilities in power grids. These instabilities are reduced with an intrahour solar forecast that uses ground-based sky imaging systems. Sky imaging systems use lenses to acquire images concentrating light beams in a sensor. The light beams received by the sky imager have an elevation angle with respect to the device’s normal. Thus, the pixels in the image contain information from different areas of the sky within the imaging system field of view (FOV). The area of the FOV contained in the pixels increases as the elevation angle of the incident light beams decreases. When the sky imager is mounted on a solar tracker, the light beam’s angle of incidence in a pixel varies over time. This investigation formulates and compares two geospatial reprojections that transform the original Euclidean frame of the imager’s plane to the geospatial atmosphere cross section where the sky imager’s FOV intersects the cloud layer. One assumes that an object (i.e., cloud) moving in the troposphere is sufficiently far so the Earth’s surface is approximated flat. The other transformation takes into account the curvature of the Earth in the portion of the atmosphere (i.e., voxel) that is recorded. The results show that the differences between the dimensions calculated by both geospatial transformations are in the order of magnitude of kilometers when the Sun’s elevation angle is below 30°.},

The proposed method estimates the motion of clouds in a sequence of consecutive sky images by extracting features of cloud dynamics to forecast the global horizontal irradiance reaching a photovoltaic system. The sky images are acquired using a low-cost infrared sky imager mounted on a solar tracker. The solar forecasting algorithm is based on kernel learning methods and uses the clear sky index as the response variable and features extracted from clouds as covariates. The proposed algorithm achieved 16.48% forecasting skill 8 min ahead with a resolution of 1 min. Previous work reached 15.4% forecasting skill with 1 min resolution. Additionally, this investigation evaluates and compares the performances of multi-task Bayesian learning methods which provide a probabilistic forecast. The proposed solar forecasting algorithm can potentially assist grid operators in managing the inherent uncertainties of power grids with a high participation of solar energy resources.}

Multiple processing methods are proposed here that take advantage of a hybrid approach to approximate the optimal parameters of physical models using computationally inexpensive machine learning models. A signal processing method removes cyclostationary biases in high-resolution clear sky index values found when detrending GSI measurements using the clear sky GSI. Image processing methods are then used to remove the effects of atmospheric radiation and the Sun’s direct radiation from infrared sky images, plus the radiation effect emitted by debris on the sky imager’s germanium outdoor lens.

It allows power systems to address the intermittency of the energy supply at different spatiotemporal scales. To anticipate the future impact of cloud displacements on the energy generated by solar facilities, conventional modeling methods rely on numerical weather prediction or physical models, which have difficulties in assimilating cloud information and learning systematic biases. Augmenting computer vision with machine learning overcomes some of these limitations by fusing real-time cloud cover observations with surface measurements acquired from multiple sources. This Review summarizes recent progress in solar forecasting from multisensor Earth observations with a focus on deep learning, which provides the necessary theoretical framework to develop architectures capable of extracting relevant information from data generated by ground-level sky cameras, satellites, weather stations, and sensor networks. Overall, machine learning has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of solar energy meteorology; however, more research is necessary to realize this potential and address its limitations.},

    abstract = {We propose and analyze the application of statistical functional depth metrics for the selection of extreme scenarios for realized electric load, as well as solar and wind generation in day-ahead grid planning. Our primary motivation is screening probabilistic scenarios to identify those most relevant for operational risk mitigation. To handle the high-dimensionality of the scenarios across asset classes and intra-day periods, we employ functional measures of depth to sub-select outlying scenarios that are most likely to be the riskiest for the grid operation. We investigate a range of functional depth measures, as well as a range of operational risks, including load shedding, operational costs, reserve shortfalls, and variable renewable energy curtailment. The effectiveness of the proposed screening approach is demonstrated through a case study on the realistic Texas-7k grid.}
