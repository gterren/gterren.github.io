abstract = {Photovoltaic systems are sensitive to cloud shadow projection, which needs to be forecasted to reduce the noise impacting the intra-hour forecast of global solar irradiance. We present a comparison between different kernel discriminative models for cloud detection. The models are solved in the primal formulation to make them feasible in real-time applications. The performances are compared using the j-statistic. The infrared cloud images have been preprocessed to remove debris, which increases the performance of the analyzed methods. The use of the pixels’ neighboring features also leads to a performance improvement. Discriminative models solved in the primal yield a dramatically lower computing time along with high performance in the segmentation.}
