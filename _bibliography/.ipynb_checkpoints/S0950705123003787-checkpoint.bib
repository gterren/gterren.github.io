abstract = {To improve the performance of an intra-hour global solar irradiance forecasting algorithm, it is important to detect multiple layers of clouds. Horizontal atmospheric wind shear causes wind velocity fields to have different directions and speeds. In images of clouds acquired using ground-based sky imagers, clouds may be moving in different wind layers. The information provided by a solar forecasting algorithm is necessary to optimize and schedule the solar generation resources and storage devices in a smart grid. This investigation studies the performance of unsupervised learning techniques when detecting the number of cloud layers in infrared sky images. The images are acquired using an innovative infrared sky imager mounted on a solar tracker. Different mixture models are used to infer the distribution of the cloud features. Multiple Bayesian metrics and a sequential hidden Markov model are implemented to find the optimal number of clusters in the mixture models, and their performances are compared. The motion vectors are computed using a probabilistic implementation of the Lucas-Kanade algorithm. The correlations between the cloud motion vectors and temperatures are analyzed to discover the method that leads to the most accurate results. The findings point that a sequential hidden Markov model outperforms the detection accuracy of standard Bayesian model selection metrics.}
