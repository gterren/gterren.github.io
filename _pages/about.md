I am a Postdoctoral Climate Innovation Fellow affiliated with the Environmetal Studies Program at the University of California Santa Barbara in the US. I received a Bachelor's degree in Technical Industrial Engineering from the Universidad de Zaragoza in Spain, and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of New Mexico in the US. 

My research interets are electricity markets, power grids, macro-energy systems and energy forecast. In particular, I focus on operating reserves and planning reserve margin estimation combining probabilistic machine learning, optimization, and remote sensing.
