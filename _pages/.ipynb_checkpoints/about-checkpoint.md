I am a <a href='https://www.cnsi.ucsb.edu/programs/climate-innovation-fellows'>Climate Innovation Postdoctoral Fellow</a> affiliated with the <a href='https://es.ucsb.edu/'>Environmetal Studies Program</a> and the <a href='https://emlab.ucsb.edu/'>Environmental Markets Lab (emLab)</a> at the <a href='https://www.ucsb.edu/'>University of California Santa Barbara</a> in the United States. I received a Bachelor's degree in Technical Industrial Engineering from the <a href='https://www.unizar.es/'>Escuela de Ingenier√≠a y Arquitecture</a> at the <a href='https://www.unizar.es/'>Universidad de Zaragoza</a> in Spain, and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the <a href='http://www.ece.unm.edu/'>Electrical and Computer Engineering Department</a> at the <a href='https://www.unm.edu/'>University of New Mexico</a> in the United States. 

My research interests include electricity markets, power grids, macro-energy systems, and energy forecasts. In particular, I focus on the estimation of short-term operating reserves and the long-term planning reserve margin, combining probabilistic machine learning, optimization, and remote sensing.
