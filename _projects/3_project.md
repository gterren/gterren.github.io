I constructed an sky imager (`Girasol Machine`) with far-infrared and multi-exposure fisheye visible light capabilities mounted on a solar tracker, so the Sun is in the center of the sky images throughtout the day. We developed a noise reduction software and image fusion algorithm to merge the fisheye sky images with different exposures to obtain a low signal-to-noise ratio sky image with a high dynamic range {% cite TERRENSERRANO2021106914 %}. 

The <a href='https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.zcrjdfn9m'>Girasol dataset</a> is publicly accessible in a Dryad repository. The <a href='https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.zcrjdfn9m'>Girasol dataset</a> is composed of 300 sample days of multi-exposure fisheye visisble lgiht and far-infrared sky images and irradiande measuerments collected every 15 second resolution in Albuquerque, NM, USA.
